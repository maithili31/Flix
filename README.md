Features :
Creating a Modern Look: I used ChakraUI to design a modern and responsive user interface that looks good on all devices.
Fetching Movie Data: I connected to an external API(TMDB) to get movie data and display it dynamically on our website.
Secure User Login: I used Firebase to set up user authentication, allowing users to log in securely and have a personalized experience.
Managing Watchlists: I integrated Firebase Database so users can create and manage their own movie watchlists.
