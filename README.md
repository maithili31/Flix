Tech Used : 
1. React 18
2. Chakra UI
3. Firebase Auth and Firestore
4. TMDB API

Features :
## THERE IS NO AUTO SEARCH. WRITE THE NAME OF THE MOVIE/TV SHOW AND PRESS ENTER. SEARCH WILL WORK.
Creating a Modern Look: I used ChakraUI to design a modern and responsive user interface that looks good on all devices.
Fetching Movie Data: I connected to an external API(TMDB) to get movie data and display it dynamically on our website.
Secure User Login: I used Firebase to set up user authentication, allowing users to log in securely and have a personalized experience.
Managing Watchlists: I integrated Firebase Database so users can create and manage their own movie watchlists.

Steps : -
1. Created Vite application and setup Chakra UI
2. Installation of React Router and Routes were made.
3. Planning and implementing the Pages and Layout
4. Usage of TMDB API and performed the fetching functions
5. Firebase was setup (the authentication)
6. Cloud Firestore was setup.
7. ProtectedRoute was setup for the watchlist part.
8. The above UI setup was for laptop screen . So I made the UI responsive for mobile screen as well.
9. Deployed using vercel application.
    Thank You.
